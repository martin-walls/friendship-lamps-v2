# Friendship Lamps v2

([v1](https://github.com/martin-walls/friendship-lamps-v1))

Two ESP32 powered lamps that sync their colour between them whenever one of them is changed.

### Updates from v1:
- New lamp design!
- Now with RGBW
- Cycle through chosen preset colours rather than just having a colour wheel
- Send pulses from one lamp to the other
